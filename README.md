**As of September 2016, not maintained. If someone wants to take over the mod, notify me (I'd much prefer if you could message me on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/Tbsc_), if you can't then message me on GitHub).**

This rewrite will make the mod behave differently, but I'm working to make the rewrite backwards-compatible. Meaning that a world created with Techy v1.x.x will load fine on Techy v2.x.x.x. That doesn't necessarily mean that works in the opposite way.
