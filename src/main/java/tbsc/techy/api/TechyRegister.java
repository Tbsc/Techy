/**
 * This annotation should be put on any class that can be registered using {@link GameRegistry#register(IForgeRegistryEntry)},
 * therefore any class that's implementing {@link IForgeRegistryEntry}.
 * What it'll do is register the class to the game, and based on what the class implements, register other things.
 * For example, if a block implements {@link net.minecraft.block.ITileEntityProvider}, it'll register the tile
 * entity for the block.
