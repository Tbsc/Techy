# Techy TODO List

This list contains everything that needs to be done in the mod.
Note that this is different from issues; Things that get here ***will*** be done sometime in the future - issues won't necessarily be done at all.

Everything here is divided by sections and is in tables, more information will be after the tables.

### Bugs

| Critical                                   | Important                                                  |   Later   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Pipe bounding boxes                        | Powered furnace "working" property<sup>*<sup>1</sup></sup> |           |
| Automatic transfer<sup>*<sup>2</sup></sup> |                                                            |           |

*<sup>1</sup> - This means that when the furnace is running, it should change the front texture and display particles

*<sup>2</sup> - Machines should automatically pull and push items from nearby inventories, while checking if they can (ISidedInventory)

### Features

| Critical     | Important                              |   Later                            |

| Power Cells  | Storage Blocks<sup>*<sup>1</sup></sup> | Fluid Pipes<sup>*<sup>2</sup></sup>|
| Item Pipes   |                                        |                                    |

*<sup>1</sup> - By storage blocks I mean stuff like copper blocks. Just a way to compact resources to a smaller form

*<sup>2</sup> - I'll add these when they are needed. Right now nothing in my mod uses fluids, so there's no need for fluid pipes

### Improvements

| Critical     | Important                                     |   Later   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
|              | Boosters<sup>*<sup>1</sup></sup>              |           |
|              | Progression & content<sup>*<sup>2</sup></sup> |           |

*<sup>1</sup> - While there are already boosters in the mod, they don't do anything (or when they do, they don't do it correctly) and they have no crafting recipes. As of now what I need to do is recode how machines handle boosters, and add crafting recipes. Crafting recipes will be added AFTER I get them working, so no one would make them for no reason.

\*<sup>2</sup> - I've already started with that. For example, to get to the second tier you need dusts from the first tier, and for the third tier you'll need stuff from the second tier (perhaps lithium, that'll only be able to be processed using second tier machines?) I also said that I want content. There is content in the mod, but that's mostly utilities for typical Minecraft gameplay. I want the mod to have unique stuff, that people will actually **PLAY** with the mod instead of **USE** it. Got it? :P
