## Techy TODO List

# Bugs
* Pipe bounding boxes
* Powered furnace doesn't change "working" property
* *(WIP)* Automatic extraction from nearby inventories/insertion to nearby inventories
~~* Coal generator will fill its internal buffer upon inserting fuel~~

# Features
* Storage blocks for resources
* Power Cells
  - 4 tiers: Usual tiers + creative tier
* Actual content rather then just utilities:
  - Progression, which I've started by requiring a crusher to create an improved machine base
* More pipes
  - Item pipes
  - *(Low priority, only when I add stuff that uses fluids)* Fluid pipes
~~* Finish connection render between machines~~

# Improvements
* Boosters
  - While there are boosters, they don't affect machines, nor have any crafting recipes
* ~~JEI Support~~
  ~~- Appearance~~
