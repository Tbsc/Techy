## Techy TODO List

# Bugs
* Pipe bounding boxes

# Features
* Storage blocks for resources
* Actual content rather then just utilities:
  - Progression, which I've started by requiring a crusher to create an improved machine base
* More pipes
  - Item pipes
  - *(Low priority, only when I add stuff that uses fluids)* Fluid pipes

# Improvements
* ~~JEI Support~~
  ~~- Appearance~~
* Boosters
  - While there are boosters, they don't affect machines, nor have any crafting recipes
